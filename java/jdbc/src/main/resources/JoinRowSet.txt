JoinRowSet

A JoinRowSet implementation lets you create a SQL JOIN between RowSet objects when they are not connected to a data source.

Creating JoinRowSet Objects
	JoinRowSet jrs = new JoinRowSetImpl();
	The variable jrs holds nothing until RowSet objects are added to it.

Adding RowSet Objects
	Any RowSet object can be added to a JoinRowSet object as long as it can be part of a SQL JOIN.

Managing Match Columns
	The column on which the JOIN is based, is called the match column.
	
	The first way is to pass the match column to the JoinRowSet method addRowSet, as shown in the following line of code:
		jrs.addRowSet(coffees, 2);
		jrs.addRowSet(suppliers, 1);
		jrs.addRowSet(coffees, "SUP_ID");
		
Currently the only type that is implemented is JoinRowSet.INNER_JOIN.
