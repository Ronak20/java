FilteredRowSet

A FilteredRowSet object lets you cut down the number of rows that are visible in a RowSet object.
The query's WHERE clause defines the filtering criteria.A FilteredRowSet object provides a way for 
a disconnected RowSet object to do this filtering without having to execute a query on the data 
source, thus avoiding having to get a connection to the data source and sending queries to it.

	Ability to limit the rows that are visible according to set criteria
    Ability to select which data is visible without being connected to a data source
	

Defining Filtering Criteria in Predicate Objects
	To set the criteria for which rows in a FilteredRowSet object will be visible, you define a class that implements the 
	Predicate interface.
	
	An object created with this class is initialized with the following:
    The high end of the range within which values must fall
    The low end of the range within which values must fall
    The column name or column number of the column with the value that must fall within the range of values set by the high and 
    low boundaries
	

Creating FilteredRowSet Objects
	use an instance of RowSetFactory
	Using constructor

Creating and Setting Predicate Objects
	frs.setFilter(myStateFilter);

	To do the actual filtering, you call the method next, which in the reference implementation calls the appropriate version 
	of the Predicate.evaluate method that you have implemented previously.

	If the return value is true, the row will be visible; if the return value is false, the row will not be visible.

Setting FilteredRowSet Objects with New Predicate Objects to Filter Data Further
	After calling the method next on each row, which makes visible only those rows that satisfy the filter, you can call 
	setFilter again, passing it a different Predicate object. Even though only one filter is set at a time, the effect is 
	that both filters apply cumulatively.

Updating FilteredRowSet Objects
	You can insert a new row or change one or more values in an existing row if the new value or values are within the 
	filtering criteria.

Inserting or Updating Rows
	If a row to be inserted does not meet the cumulative filtering criteria in effect, it will be blocked from being added.

Removing All Filters so All Rows Are Visible
	frs.setFilter(null);

Deleting Rows
	Delete the row as long as the row is visible.
