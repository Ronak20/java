JDBC Product Components

JDBC includes four components:

1.	The JDBC API — The JDBC™ API provides programmatic access to relational data from the Java programming language.
	The JDBC 4.0 API is divided into two packages: java.sql and javax.sql.
	
2.	JDBC Driver Manager — The JDBC DriverManager class defines objects which can connect Java applications to a 
	JDBC driver. The Standard Extension packages javax.naming and javax.sql let you use a DataSource object 
	registered with a Java Naming and Directory Interface(JNDI) naming service to establish a connection with 
	a data source. 
	
3.	JDBC Test Suite — The JDBC driver test suite helps you to determine that JDBC drivers will run your program. 
	These tests are not comprehensive or exhaustive, but they do exercise many of the important features in the JDBC API.

4.	JDBC-ODBC Bridge — The Java Software bridge provides JDBC access via ODBC drivers. Note that you need to load ODBC 
	binary code onto each client machine that uses this driver. As a result, the ODBC driver is most appropriate on a 
	corporate network where client installations are not a major problem, or for application server code written in 
	Java in a three-tier architecture.

The last two components are used in specialized environments to test web applications, or to communicate with ODBC-aware DBMSs.
