A Relational Database Overview

	A relational database is one that presents information in tables with rows and columns. 
	A table is referred to as a relation in the sense that it is a collection of objects of the same type (rows). 
	Data in a table can be related according to common keys or concepts, and the ability to retrieve related data 
	from a table is the basis for the term relational database. 
	
	A Database Management System (DBMS) handles the way data is stored, maintained, and retrieved. In the case of a 
	relational database, a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) performs these tasks.

Result Sets and Cursors

	The rows that satisfy the conditions of a query are called the result set. A cursor can be thought of as a pointer 
	into a file that contains the rows of the result set.

Transactions

	When one user is accessing data in a database, another user may be accessing the same data at the same time.
	It is possible for the second user to get partly old data and partly updated data. For this reason, DBMSs use transactions 
	to maintain data in a consistent state (data consistency) while allowing more than one user to access a database 
	at the same time (data concurrency).
	
	A transaction is a set of one or more SQL statements that make up a logical unit of work. A transaction ends with 
	either a commit or a rollback.
	
	A lock is a mechanism that prohibits two transactions from manipulating the same data at the same time.


Stored Procedures

	A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that can be called by name.
	
Metadata

	Databases store user data, and they also store information about the database itself.
