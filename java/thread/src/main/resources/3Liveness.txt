Liveness
A concurrent application's ability to execute in a timely manner is known as its liveness.
Two other liveness problems, starvation and livelock.

Deadlock
Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.

Starvation and Livelock
This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads.

Livelock
A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of 
another thread, then livelock may result.However, the threads are not blocked — they are simply too busy responding to each other 
to resume work.
